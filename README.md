# Awesome Drinks API

This is a Java Spring based web API with the aim of test and validate some of the tools that the Spring framework offers.

The project is built to fulfil the 4 HTTP verbs, meaning ```GET```, ```POST```, ```PUT``` and ```DELETE``` to make easier the development of apps based on APIs.

If you have any question or suggestions, please send me an e-mail on washington.moises@gmail.com, I'll be glad to hear from you. 



This project is entirely based on Java Spring samples on https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/
